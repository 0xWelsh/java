# Java Identifiers
IDENTIFIERS
all java variables must be identified with unique names.
these unique names are called identifiers

identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names
(age, sum, totalVolume).

`Note:` It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create
understandable and maintainable code:
```
// good
int minutesPerHour = 60;

// ok, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
int m = 60;
```

The general rules for naming variables are:
- names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- names must begin with a letter
- names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
- names also begin with $ and _
- names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
- reserved words (like Java keyboards, such as `int` or `boolean`) cannot
be used as names
